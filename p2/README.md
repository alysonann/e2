## Outside resources

I used [CSS Button Generator](https://www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com) to style my submit button.

I used [rock](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-rock?style=solid), [paper](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-paper?style=solid), and [scissors](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-scissors?style=solid) icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).

I also used the Google Font [Indie Flower](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower?selection.family=Indie+Flower) for the main text and [Paytone One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Paytone+One?selection.family=Paytone+One&query=paytone&preview.text=Project%202&preview.text_type=custom) for the headings.

I used this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18272497/styling-input-radio-with-css/18272642) post to remind myself how to style inputs of one type (I adjusted the margin on my radio buttons, but not the text input).

## Notes for instructor

I wanted the player to be able to customize their own name, but knew it might be a little annoying if are you playing over and over, so I pre-filled a value in the field.
