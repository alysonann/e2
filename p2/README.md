## Outside resources

+I used the [CSS Button Generator](https://www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com) to style my submit button.

+I used [rock](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-rock?style=solid), [paper](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-paper?style=solid), and [scissors](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-scissors?style=solid) icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).

+I used the Google Font [Indie Flower](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower?selection.family=Indie+Flower) for the main text and [Paytone One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Paytone+One?selection.family=Paytone+One&query=paytone&preview.text=Project%202&preview.text_type=custom) for the headings.

+I used this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18272497/styling-input-radio-with-css/18272642) post to review how to style inputs of one type.

+I used this [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-required-attribute) reference page for clarification on making one choice in a group of radio buttons required. For clarity, as suggested, I added "required" to each radio button. I was directed to that help page from a [Stack Overflow post: How to use the “required” attribute with a “radio” input field](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8287779/how-to-use-the-required-attribute-with-a-radio-input-field).
## Notes for instructor

I wanted the player to be able to customize their own name, but knew it might be a little annoying if they are playing (or testing!) over and over, so I pre-filled a value in the field.
