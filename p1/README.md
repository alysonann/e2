## Outside resources
While working through some issues with my generated player moves, I reviewed [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19393294/generating-random-numbers-and-setting-them-as-variables-to-use-later) on Stack Overflow to review how I was setting my variables with the random number generator.

I used [rock](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-rock?style=solid), [paper](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-paper?style=solid), and [scissors](https://fontawesome.com/icons/hand-scissors?style=solid) icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com).

I also used the Google Font [Gloria Hallelujah](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gloria+Hallelujah?query=gloria.).

## Notes for instructor

I tried to make the program a little more complicated, but ultimately didn't end up doing that--I wanted to implement a "best of three," but found it more involved than I originally thought it would be (I need more practice with multi-dimensional arrays!). I was able to put my results in an array, but couldn't figure out how to successfully output information from the array in the HTML in the way I needed to.  Ultimately I decided an array wasn't necessary for the simple approach I ended up taking, and I just echoed the variables rather array elements in my HTML.
